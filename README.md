# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a simple simulation of the 'X' and 'O' game which we play on paper.

The program displays a 3x3 grid as well as the index locations. To play, you have to input the locations and accordingly the grid gets updated. When 3 'X' or 'O' occurs in a straight line or diagonally, the program ends after indicating the winner.

This repo contains multiple versions of the same game, each of which is supposed to have more features and/or more effective code than the previous.
